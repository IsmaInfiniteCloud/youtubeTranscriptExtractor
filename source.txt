all right we will go ahead and get
0:07
started um as i noted this is our
0:10
webinar about genesis cloud queue
0:11
settings my name is tom with inflow and
0:13
i will be taking you through this
0:14
webinar today before we get started we
0:17
are going to talk a little bit about
0:18
inflow what we can do for you and your
0:20
business and make sure that your voice
0:22
applications are working the way that
0:23
they they should be for your environment
0:26
then we're going to jump right into the
0:27
queue setup where we'll be talking about
0:28
the different facets of the cues the
0:30
cues portion within the admin section of
0:33
genesis cloud and go over the various
0:35
configurations that you can do within
0:37
those queues
About Inflow
0:38
so a little bit about inflow here who is
0:40

1:12
and we offer full end end capabilities
1:14
in ucas ccas wfm wfo analytics and other
1:18
customer engagement services
1:21
here's a quick snippet of some of the
1:23
customers that we do support
1:28
and a few of our technology partners as
1:30
well
1:34
as we go through the webinar there is a
1:36
q a box in your zoom application you can
1:38
use that to ask questions as we go
1:40
through at the end of the webinar i will
1:41
take a look and answer any questions
1:43
that i do see um that are in this q a
1:45
portion
1:46
if we have any questions that i cannot
1:48
directly answer i will make sure to get
1:50
your contact information so that we can
1:52
get you that answer before the end of
1:54
the business day
1:55
and so with that we're going to go ahead
1:57
and jump directly into it i'll go ahead
1:59
and full screen this to make it easier
2:00
to see
2:02
and as you can see we are currently in
2:04
the admin panel of genesis cloud and
2:07
what we are going to be talking about
2:08
today is specifically the various
2:10
settings within the queues that you can
2:12
create within genesis cloud and how to
2:15
configure those this is going to um be
2:18
focused specifically on the queue set up
2:20
within the contact center tab so we
2:22
aren't going to be going into the
2:23
architect portion um which is the way
2:26
that you actually get those calls to
2:28
your queues um but we're going to talk
2:29
about the different setups within queues
2:31
and what would be required as well so
2:34
first thing i'm going to do is i'm going
2:35
to find cues which is under contact
2:36
center if you aren't super familiar with
2:38
with the layout in the admin portal as
2:40
well you can use the search bar
2:43
if i start typing in cues cues will pop
2:45
up there as well i'm going to go ahead
2:46
and click into it
2:48
when i do
2:49
it's going to pop up all the cues that
2:51
are currently built within the
2:53
organization that i'm looking at as you
2:54
can see we have quite a few in our
2:56
sandbox environment we use this for a
2:58
lot of internal testing
3:00
if you're looking for a specific queue
3:01
you can look for them up in the top
3:03
right here otherwise you can search
3:04
through the pages in this case i will
3:06
look for mine
3:07
which will be this tom test queue and
3:09
we're going to talk about the different
3:10
things that we can do here so i'm going
Queue Overview
3:13
to go ahead and click into the tom test
3:14
queue this is going to bring me to a
3:16
page with a number of different tabs
3:17
that we can look at for different
3:19
configuration options with this queue
3:21
now the queue is going to be how you
3:24
actually facilitate the actual call
3:26
center method of taking calls so this is
3:28
where you would set up your agents so
3:31
that they can they can pick up calls um
3:33
as needed as they go through the call
3:35
flows and it can apply not only to calls
3:37
but depending on your organization you
3:39
might use cues for chat for messaging
3:41
and for email as well so there's a few
3:44
different things that you can do with
3:45
cues and there's a lot of different
3:47
options that you have available to you
3:50
so
3:51
for starters here up at the top we've
3:54
got our name and description name is
3:55
simply going to be the name of the queue
3:57
this is going to be how you see it in
3:59
the cues tab as well as how you would
4:01
call the queue
4:03
um when you try to assign it into a flow
4:06
within architect you would want to know
4:08
this name otherwise this name is not
4:11
necessarily anything that you have to
4:13
make a um specific thing you can do
4:15
whatever you want within your system to
4:17
make sure that you know what this is to
4:20
go hand in hand in that with that is a
4:22
description if you want to give your cue
4:23
a description you can do that here this
4:25
is just a flavor text box so if i wanted
4:27
to for example
4:30
training queue for
4:34
webinars
4:36
if i put that in there that would simply
4:37
show up in the queues overview so i
4:40
could find what i'm looking for just a
4:42
little bit easier
4:43
down below that we also have our
4:45
division if you are familiar with
4:47
divisions this is a way that you can
4:49
logically separate your system out um
4:52
so that only only certain facets of your
4:55
system are visible to certain people so
4:57
for example if you have multiple uh
4:59
multiple sites in your system and you
5:00
have um
5:02
employees that are responsible for those
5:04
sites but no other sites within your
5:06
call center you can use divisions to
5:08
divide that up to make sure that your
5:10
users can only see what they're supposed
5:12
to
5:13
from a cue standpoint that's going to
5:15
simply dictate who can see the queue
5:17
availability and who can make changes to
5:19
the queue
5:20
for most of you this will stay in the
5:22
home division which is totally fine
5:24
and then we have after call work and
5:26
this is actually where the first piece
5:28
that many many of our customers use
5:30
comes into play for queue and this is
5:33
going to be for any type of interaction
5:35
that the that the queue takes whether
5:37
it's just a voice interaction or if you
5:39
are doing chat message email or you are
5:41
doing callbacks from that queue
5:43
um you have
After Call Work
5:45
four different options with after call
5:46
work which is the time that your agents
5:49
get after they take a call um to finish
5:52
up anything that they need to do before
5:54
they can get back in and start receiving
5:56
more interactions so to talk about the
5:58
four different options optional just
6:00
allows your agent to choose whether or
6:02
not they want to go into after call work
6:04
so that they can finish up what they
6:06
need to do if they choose not to they're
6:08
placed directly back into the queue and
6:10
are directly available for additional
6:12
calls at that time um if they do place
6:14
themselves in after call work there is
6:16
no upper limit at this point so if you
6:19
are set to optional they can keep
6:20
themselves an afro call work as long as
6:22
they need to
6:23
until they are ready to start taking
6:25
calls again
6:27
mandatory discretionary is similar um
6:31
the mandatory portion will force your
6:33
agents into after call work after each
6:35
call however it is at their discretion
6:38
when they will be able to actually
6:40
leave after call work and start taking
6:42
calls again however there is no upper
6:44
limit again so it is on the agent to
6:47
decide how long they are going to remain
6:49
in after call work before they return to
6:51
the queue using mandatory and
6:53
discretionary method
6:54
the other two options are essentially
6:57
the same but mandatory time box will put
7:00
a limit on how long after call work can
7:02
be and that will actually apply in this
7:05
option here for the after call work
7:07
timeout which is in seconds so as an
7:10
example here if i have 30 seconds in
7:12
this box
7:13
then with this setup mandatory time box
7:16
and an after call work timeout of 30
7:17
seconds your agent is going to
7:19
automatically be placed into after call
7:21
work after his call is done
7:23
they would be able to
7:25
leave after call work at any time that
7:27
they deem appropriate however after 30
7:30
seconds they are automatically removed
7:32
from after call work and are placed back
7:34
into the queue
7:35
so that that would be an example of time
7:37
box here and then finally there is also
7:39
mandatory time box no early exit
7:43
and in this case
7:45
and you can see here it does apply to
7:47
voice conversations here um in this
7:50
particular case with the same setup your
7:52
agent will be placed into after call
7:54
work for 30 seconds they cannot leave
7:56
after call work and after 30 seconds
7:58
they would be placed back into the queue
7:59
so this would be essentially a mandatory
8:02
30-second break for them to finish up
8:04
whatever it is that they were doing to
8:07
allow allow them to be ready for their
8:09
next interaction
8:12
in addition there is this box for manual
8:14
assignment this allows from the
8:16
supervisor tab this allows um folks to
8:20
actually place people into the queue as
8:21
needed manual assignment would allow
8:23
that to occur with this off you would
8:26
have to be a member of the queue to be
8:27
active in the queue
8:29
so that would be for temporary
8:30
assignment for things like overflow
8:31
purposes
Routing
8:33
and that concludes the general tab the
8:35
next thing we're going to go to is the
8:36
routing tab here the routing tab
8:39
can go from fairly simple to fairly
8:42
complex and so we're going to talk about
8:44
that here
8:45
there are three different methods of
8:47
routing within genesis cloud you have
8:50
standard routing which would simply be
8:53
longest idle for your agents so if you
8:55
have a number of agents in the queue it
8:57
is not looking for anything like
8:59
skills-based routing it isn't looking
9:00
for anything specific there it is just
9:03
looking at your pool of agents who is
9:04
available and is going to choose whoever
9:06
has been available the longest to send
9:08
that call to
Bullseye Routing
9:10
your other options however are bullseye
9:12
routing and preferred agent routing
9:13
we're going to start with bullseye
9:15
routing
9:16
because this is a very common
9:17
methodology for routing within the
9:19
system what bullseye routing does is it
9:21
allows you to add
9:23
different um different bullseye markers
9:26
um or points in the system
9:28
where you can specify which agents
9:30
should get calls first
9:32
um and you can do things like remove
9:34
skills to to increase your pool of
9:37
agents um
9:38
and add multiple rings to this to to
9:41
kind of create an escalation and
9:43
overflow for your queue
Bullseye Routing Example
9:45
so as an example here if i add just a
9:47
couple rings here um it's going to start
9:50
at point one which you can see is listed
9:52
as one and then it will move to two and
9:54
then three
9:55
and then finally it would end at four
9:57
and all these are configurable so for
10:00
example let's say i want my initial
10:03
agents
10:04
to be um to get the call for 30 seconds
10:07
before it moves to 0.2
10:10
maybe i want this to then ring for 90
10:12
seconds and keep in mind here
10:14
anything anything um that was in marker
10:18
one also applies to two here so once we
10:20
move to two
10:21
any agents with with bullseye two will
10:24
be ring as well as any agents that
10:26
become available under bullseye one
10:28
um and then finally once it gets to
10:30
three anything in three would be added
10:33
to that as well so in this particular
10:35
case call would come in it would ring
10:37
any agents marked as bullseye one for 30
10:40
seconds then it would ring anybody
10:42
anybody with bullseye 2 or bullseye 1
10:44
for 90 seconds and then anybody with
10:46
three two or one for 90 seconds and then
10:50
after that once it hits four
10:52
all agents in the queue become available
10:54
here so this can be used as an overflow
10:56
where you have some
10:58
um some agents that potentially can
11:00
handle the calls that could come into
11:01
the queue um or interactions for that
11:04
matter because it can be any other type
11:06
of interaction for this as well um
11:08
but um should not be the front line this
11:11
would be a way to do that in addition if
11:13
you do use skill based routing
11:16
in your system you can remove skills
11:18
with each of these bullseye ring exits
11:20
to improve the ability to take these
11:22
calls so for example maybe you have a
11:24
support queue that uses support scaling
11:26
um support skill the support skill would
11:29
be required to answer any of those calls
11:31
coming through the queue
11:32
um but maybe after on bullseye ring
11:36
three you would then remove that skill
11:40
which it looks like we don't have one
11:42
directly searchable but um the
11:45
um if you remove the skill that's no
11:47
longer attached to the call and queue
11:48
and then anybody that doesn't have the
11:50
skill could then pick up the call so
11:52
this allows you to use
11:53
um overflow agents that aren't
11:55
necessarily skilled for the for the
11:57
calls that they would be taking as
11:59
overflow just to make sure that they can
12:00
actually pick those calls up
12:02
um now um
12:05
this goes hand in hand with your
12:06
evaluation method
12:08
um which the default in the system is
12:10
going to be all skills matching if there
12:12
is a skill associated with the call
12:14
which happens via architect
12:16
then it looks for anybody in the queue
12:18
that has that skill to match um your
12:22
other options are best available skills
12:24
this is actually based on the skills
12:26
slider
12:27
that you can assign to agents so this
12:29
would be the star rating that you give
12:31
them for the skill best available skills
12:32
is going to take a look at the
12:35
agents that are available
12:37
that have the correct skill and then it
12:40
was going to prefer the agents that have
12:42
a higher skill level of that available
12:45
skill
12:46
and then finally there's also disregard
12:48
skills next agent this does this simply
12:50
tells the system not to care
12:52
if you're using a skill on the cued call
12:54
or not it's simply going to look for the
12:56
next available agent that has been idle
12:58
for the longest so you can use any of
13:00
those for whatever method you need here
13:03
um now
Preferred Agent Routing
13:05
this is for bullseye routing there is
13:07
also preferred agent routing which i'm
13:09
going to go over briefly here this is
13:11
actually more architect than it is q
13:13
methodology
13:14
um however
13:16
what this will allow you to do is
13:18
configure preferred agents for specific
13:20
interaction types in architect and you
13:22
can add rings
13:24
for specific scores for those agents so
13:27
it's very similar to bullseye routing
13:28
and skill based routing is just another
13:31
way to do so and you can actually
13:32
combine this with standard or bullseye
13:35
routing as well so you can do a
13:37
preferred list of agents followed by
13:38
bullseye routing if you so desire if you
13:41
want more information on preferred agent
13:42
routing that would be covered in a later
13:44
course that would that would revolve
13:46
around architect if you have any
13:47
questions about it that would be a good
13:49
thing to contact our support team about
Members
13:53
next let's go to members and this is
13:54
going to let me show you the bullseye by
13:57
routing as well so i'm actually going to
13:58
before we get in there i'm going to save
14:00
this real quick
14:02
and then go back to it
Save Settings
14:05
which another thing to note about the
14:07
cues and really any tab within architect
14:10
or i'm sorry within genesis cloud is if
14:12
you go and save your settings it is
14:14
going to pop you back out to the main
14:16
page
14:16
let's do that so we just have two
14:18
available there um
14:20
so that is something to keep in mind
14:22
just make sure that you have the
14:23
settings in that you want to put into
14:26
the key
Add New Members
14:27
so now that that's set up here let's go
14:29
ahead and go to members here and you'll
14:31
see i have a blank slate here i don't
14:33
have any members in my page at the
14:36
moment now to select new members i can
14:38
search by by specific name so if i look
14:40
for tom here so i've got a few wfm users
14:43
that i use for another training that i
14:45
do if i wanted to add these users to the
14:47
queue i could simply choose them
14:51
and you'll see it gets added into that
14:52
little box here
14:55
and then when i hit this little plus now
Advanced Tab
14:58
all of those users are added
15:00
if i wanted to look a little bit harder
15:02
at the users that i can add i can click
15:04
this advanced tab this advanced tab will
15:06
allow me to
15:07
search by different different methods so
15:10
for example maybe they're all in an
15:12
official group within genesis cloud i
15:14
could look for that group i could look
15:16
for that specific role if i have
15:19
my users set up so that i um have their
15:21
manager information on their profiles
15:23
and i know who they report to i can do
15:25
that i can also look by location skill
15:27
or language
15:29
and you can use this pane to add users
15:31
as well so this will allow you to do um
15:34
very much the same thing that the search
15:36
by name does you can find multiple
15:38
people check their boxes and add
15:40
multiple people to the group this way as
15:42
well
Bullseye
15:44
down below you'll see all the users that
15:46
i have created in in the queue here
15:49
and
15:50
there's a bullseye ring number as well
15:52
for each one of these users which you
15:54
can see i can actually manipulate
15:56
between one and six so you can have up
15:58
to six total bullseye rings within the
16:00
system
16:01
um now the um this is going to dictate
16:04
when they get ranked so for example if
16:07
wfm1 and 2 were bullseye ring one they
16:09
would be in that first group
16:12
and if three and four are set as
16:14
bullseye ring two they would start
16:16
getting rang as part of the second
16:18
bullseye marker so to go back to the
16:20
routing here in our example here
16:24
wfm users one and two would ring for
16:26
five seconds and then all four of them
16:28
would be able to get rang after it moves
16:30
to bullseye ring two
16:32
so that's that's how bullseye works it's
16:34
very very simplistic but allows you to
16:36
do things like set up tiers for your
16:38
queues so that you can have overflow
16:40
available
Wrapup Codes
16:42
the next tab here is wrap-up codes and
16:45
wrap-up codes are simply the codes that
16:47
your agents can choose at the end of a
16:49
call
16:50
that can be used in reporting to see
16:52
what kind of calls are coming in
16:55
so for example here if i just type in
16:58
i'll just grab a couple of them here not
17:01
support request not interested and
17:06
not so happy customer and we'll go ahead
17:07
and hit the add button here
Wrapup Codes Overview
17:09
this is all there is to it for wrap-up
17:11
codes so wrap-up codes are going to vary
17:14
based on
17:15
um the customer and what what your needs
17:18
are so everybody's wrapped up codes will
17:20
be a little bit different um these these
17:22
are codes that you can create yourself
17:24
and then you simply make them available
17:26
in the queue by adding them in the wrap
17:28
up codes tab here the end result is if i
17:31
get a call from this queue and uh um and
17:35
i get connected to it i can choose one
17:37
of these wrap-up codes um on the end of
17:40
the upon the end of the call to notate
17:42
what kind of call it was
17:44
and then reporting can be used to pull
17:46
this call information
17:48
so um this this is purely for reporting
17:51
and to make sure you know what kind of
17:52
calls are coming into your contact
17:54
center
Service Level Target
17:56
and finally we have our different
17:59
interaction types so we're going to go
18:01
through these as well
18:02
voice has by far the most which makes
18:04
sense because there's more that can
18:05
happen with voice
18:07
so let's talk about the service level
18:09
and the service level target these are
18:11
reporting metrics and are meant to be
18:13
used in conjunction with performance
18:15
dance dashboards to see where
18:17
your cues lie and if you're meeting your
18:19
targets so the default is going to be a
18:22
service level of 80
18:24
with a cert or i'm sorry a service level
18:26
of 80 percent with the service level of
18:28
target of 20 seconds
18:30
what this means is the system is looking
18:33
to
18:34
see that 80 of the voice interactions
18:37
offered to this queue are answered
18:38
within 20 seconds
18:40
so that gives you an average service
18:42
level that you can be looking at for
18:44
your queue and the performance dashboard
18:46
will give you feedback on this level and
18:48
depending on what you configure will
18:51
show you whether or not you're meeting
18:53
your targets so this is something that
18:55
can be configurable
18:56
depending on the customer and queue need
18:59
um
19:00
80 out of 20 is a pretty common um setup
19:03
that we do see
Calling Party
19:06
underneath here we have a calling party
19:07
name and a calling party number and
19:09
these are on the queue because in a
19:12
queue-based interaction setup within
19:14
genesis cloud
19:16
your agents can actually make calls on
19:18
behalf of their queue
19:19
to return calls to customers
19:22
when you when this is done um the
19:25
calling party name if you're using for
19:27
example genesis cloud voice um as well
19:30
as the calling party number that you
19:31
specify here is what is going to be
19:33
outpost when you send those calls
19:35
outbound now the name does have to be
19:37
honored by the by the carriers going and
19:39
end so that can that can change um
19:42
depending on whether or not the database
19:45
of the um last mile carrier to the
19:48
person you're calling does have the name
19:50
that you were sending however the
19:51
calling party number is consistent and
19:53
will be whatever you need um so the a
19:56
good example for this here would be
19:59
a number that would actually directly
20:01
connect the um person you called back to
20:03
the queue so they know that that is you
20:06
um so that is what these two fields are
20:09
for you also have an alerting timeout
20:11
this is how long your agents will get
20:13
notified that they have an incoming call
20:15
before it moves the next agent therefore
20:18
putting that agent into not responding
20:20
the default for this is eight seconds
Queue Flows
20:24
underneath here are some um q flow and
20:27
default scripts that you can look for
20:29
for these queues the default script is
20:33
going to be a script that your agents
20:35
can look at and use for play-by-play for
20:38
their calls depending on your
20:40
organization you may or may not use
20:42
these scripts if you do have a script
20:44
that you want to use and you want it to
20:45
be the default for the queue no matter
20:47
when they get a call you can
20:50
put that script name into the default
20:52
script and it will get pulled by default
20:54
unless there is an architect flow that
20:56
overrides it
20:58
the same applies for the in queue flow
21:00
by default the enqueue flow is going to
21:02
use the default in queue flow within
21:04
architect if you have a specific enqueue
21:07
flow that has messaging that applies to
21:10
this queue you can specify it here
21:13
generally you will see that these
21:15
enqueue flows are actually called within
21:17
architect so this is already handled for
21:19
you but if you have a specific flow that
21:22
you would like to use for this queue
21:23
anytime it's reached you can put it into
21:25
the box here as well
21:28
whisper audio is simply going to let you
21:31
let you know when there's an incoming
21:32
call
21:33
um and if you want to use it there's a
21:35
whisper prompt box that you can use here
21:37
this will play in this will play audio
21:39
for an agent as a call comes in you can
21:42
set it up so that either whisper audio
21:44
plays for all agents so you can set up a
21:46
prompt for anybody that's getting a call
21:48
or if an agent is configured for auto
21:50
answer meaning they don't get a choice
21:52
whether or not they pick up the call it
21:53
just beeps into their headset you can
21:54
play whisper audio for only those agents
21:57
as well
21:59
there's also the option for voice
22:01
transcription
22:03
if you have voice transcription on for
22:05
your voicemails which is an
22:07
organization-wide setting you can turn
22:09
this on as well so that you will have
22:11
voice transcription
Chat
22:15
chat is very very simple um chat is
22:18
going is going to refer to web chat so
22:20
if you're using any sort of website
22:22
based chat with genesis cloud and you're
22:24
using this queue to handle those those
22:26
chat messages this is going to give you
22:29
more service level information which you
22:31
can see again 80 of chat interactions
22:33
within 20 seconds is the default here we
22:36
do have a different alerting timeout
22:37
which is set to 30 seconds for chat to
22:39
give people a little bit more time to
22:41
handle a chat interaction and get
22:43
started there before it would move to
22:44
the next agent and then again just like
22:47
with voice you have a default script
22:49
option the default script option would
22:51
just allow your agent to see a visual
22:52
script
22:53
with options for them for those
22:55
interactions
Messaging
22:58
and the same is essentially true for
23:01
messaging um which this is this is going
23:03
to be
23:04
more web hook messaging such as things
23:07
such as through sms
23:10
um and you can see here the service
23:11
level and the learning timeout are
23:12
exactly the same as chat you still have
23:14
the default script however there is also
23:16
an outbound sms number drop down that
23:19
you can use this is going to correspond
23:21
to an sms number that you would purchase
23:23
through genesis cloud and that number
23:25
will be used to outpost any messages
23:27
that you send in this format
Email
23:33
email again very much the same the big
23:36
difference with email is going to be
23:38
that service level target which you can
23:39
see
23:40
is actually defaulting to 86
23:42
400 seconds
23:44
um with a much higher alerting timeout
23:46
of 300 seconds this is because email
23:49
unlike the other messaging types is
23:51
generally not a real-time experience so
23:54
this is designed to give your agents a
23:56
little bit more time if you are using
23:57
email in your queues
23:59
um you can obviously adjust these to
24:01
whatever that whatever you would like to
24:03
use you can specify an outbound email
24:05
address to send to send these um these
24:08
emails from um as well as a default
24:11
script for that as well um so if you
24:14
have a specific script for email you can
24:16
use it there if you have a specific
24:17
outbound address that you would like to
24:19
use for answering email interactions you
24:21
can do that as well
24:23
and then finally you have a callback tab
callback
24:26
as well um callback is just simply an
24:28
interaction in which a
24:31
the caller has selected that they would
24:33
like a callback this does have to be
24:34
offered within architect in order for
24:36
that to be something that can be done
24:38
and just just like any of the other
24:41
interaction types it's it's governed by
24:43
its own service level and its own
24:44
alerting timeout um so this allows you
24:47
to track that and make sure that your
24:49
callbacks are working properly
time in seconds
24:52
and so with that we got about four
24:54
minutes left that does cover the options
24:57
within the queues function within
24:59
genesis cloud it does look like there is
25:03
a couple of questions here
25:05
so let's go ahead and handle these in a
25:08
real time here
25:10
first one is there a maximum time in
25:11
seconds to define for after call work
25:13
there absolutely is but i can't remember
25:15
what it is let's find out one second
25:17
here
25:20
it looks like it might be
25:24
99 seconds because i can't go any
25:26
further
25:30
and it looks like it let me it looks
25:32
like it let me
25:33
define that so let me go back here
25:37
let's see if it'll let me do any more
25:38
here there we go that's why
25:43
apparently
25:44
you can go up to 900 seconds so you you
25:47
do have quite a bit of time you can you
25:48
can place here the other option you do
25:50
have though is you can set it to
25:52
discretionary to give your agents as
25:54
much time as they require
discretionary
25:57
do the evaluation methods only apply
25:59
once it hits the final ring or do they
26:01
apply to all the rings they do apply to
26:04
all the rings so for example here um in
26:07
the routing tab if we're looking at ring
26:10
one which we'll just say 45 seconds just
26:11
to make a little easier to follow it
26:14
does follow the evaluation method so the
26:16
first thing it's going to do is it's
26:18
going to find the users
26:20
that are um that are available um that
26:24
have either the appropriate skill or if
26:26
we're doing disregard skill
26:28
um it would just find the longest idle
26:31
user if we're set to best available
26:32
skills though it's going to find those
26:34
users and then of those available users
26:36
it will select the user that
26:39
best fits the skill so it does get used
26:41
at all times
26:45
any other questions
26:47
all right don't see anything else coming
26:49
through
26:52
give it just a moment here
26:54
okay so it looks like that is all the
26:57
questions that we have at this point in
26:58
time if more questions come up after the
27:00
webinar as usually happens that's not a
27:02
problem you can always get in touch with
27:04
us after the fact and we can make sure
27:05
we get those answers to you so you can
27:07
always give us a call at
27:10
844-446-3569 or send us an email at
27:12
contactedinflowcommunications.com
27:15
just give us a general description of
27:16
your question we'll make sure that we
27:18
get the answer for you not a problem
27:21
and so with that that concludes our
27:23
webinar for today um my name is tom with
27:26
inflow thank you so much for taking the
27:28
time to join us today we do hope to see
