all right we will go ahead and get started um as i noted this is our webinar about genesis cloud queue settings my name is tom with inflow and i will be taking you through this webinar today before we get started we are going to talk a little bit about inflow what we can do for you and your business and make sure that your voice applications are working the way that they they should be for your environment then we're going to jump right into the queue setup where we'll be talking about the different facets of the cues the cues portion within the admin section of genesis cloud and go over the various configurations that you can do within those queues
About Inflow so a little bit about inflow here who is inflow what can we do for you and your business we're a leading consulting and services company enabling digital transformation through cloud customer engagement technologies currently have over 70 employees consisting of sales advisors technical contacts and customer support and we serve over a thousand um endpoint customers from mid-market to global enterprise across most verticals we like to operate with integrity transparency urgency and agility want to make sure you get all the information you need and then some for your voice application so that we can make sure it's working exactly the way that your business desires and we offer full end end capabilities in ucas ccas wfm wfo analytics and other customer engagement services here's a quick snippet of some of the customers that we do support and a few of our technology partners as well as we go through the webinar there is a q a box in your zoom application you can use that to ask questions as we go through at the end of the webinar i will take a look and answer any questions that i do see um that are in this q a portion if we have any questions that i cannot directly answer i will make sure to get your contact information so that we can get you that answer before the end of the business day and so with that we're going to go ahead and jump directly into it i'll go ahead and full screen this to make it easier to see and as you can see we are currently in the admin panel of genesis cloud and what we are going to be talking about today is specifically the various settings within the queues that you can create within genesis cloud and how to configure those this is going to um be focused specifically on the queue set up within the contact center tab so we aren't going to be going into the architect portion um which is the way that you actually get those calls to your queues um but we're going to talk about the different setups within queues and what would be required as well so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to find cues which is under contact center if you aren't super familiar with with the layout in the admin portal as well you can use the search bar if i start typing in cues cues will pop up there as well i'm going to go ahead and click into it when i do it's going to pop up all the cues that are currently built within the organization that i'm looking at as you can see we have quite a few in our sandbox environment we use this for a lot of internal testing if you're looking for a specific queue you can look for them up in the top right here otherwise you can search through the pages in this case i will look for mine which will be this tom test queue and we're going to talk about the different things that we can do here so i'm going
Queue Overview to go ahead and click into the tom test queue this is going to bring me to a page with a number of different tabs that we can look at for different configuration options with this queue now the queue is going to be how you actually facilitate the actual call center method of taking calls so this is where you would set up your agents so that they can they can pick up calls um as needed as they go through the call flows and it can apply not only to calls but depending on your organization you might use cues for chat for messaging and for email as well so there's a few different things that you can do with cues and there's a lot of different options that you have available to you so for starters here up at the top we've got our name and description name is simply going to be the name of the queue this is going to be how you see it in the cues tab as well as how you would call the queue um when you try to assign it into a flow within architect you would want to know this name otherwise this name is not necessarily anything that you have to make a um specific thing you can do whatever you want within your system to make sure that you know what this is to go hand in hand in that with that is a description if you want to give your cue a description you can do that here this is just a flavor text box so if i wanted to for example training queue for webinars if i put that in there that would simply show up in the queues overview so i could find what i'm looking for just a little bit easier down below that we also have our division if you are familiar with divisions this is a way that you can logically separate your system out um so that only only certain facets of your system are visible to certain people so for example if you have multiple uh multiple sites in your system and you have um employees that are responsible for those sites but no other sites within your call center you can use divisions to divide that up to make sure that your users can only see what they're supposed to from a cue standpoint that's going to simply dictate who can see the queue availability and who can make changes to the queue for most of you this will stay in the home division which is totally fine and then we have after call work and this is actually where the first piece that many many of our customers use comes into play for queue and this is going to be for any type of interaction that the that the queue takes whether it's just a voice interaction or if you are doing chat message email or you are doing callbacks from that queue um you have
After Call Work four different options with after call work which is the time that your agents get after they take a call um to finish up anything that they need to do before they can get back in and start receiving more interactions so to talk about the four different options optional just allows your agent to choose whether or not they want to go into after call work so that they can finish up what they need to do if they choose not to they're placed directly back into the queue and are directly available for additional calls at that time um if they do place themselves in after call work there is no upper limit at this point so if you are set to optional they can keep themselves an afro call work as long as they need to until they are ready to start taking calls again mandatory discretionary is similar um the mandatory portion will force your agents into after call work after each call however it is at their discretion when they will be able to actually leave after call work and start taking calls again however there is no upper limit again so it is on the agent to decide how long they are going to remain in after call work before they return to the queue using mandatory and discretionary method the other two options are essentially the same but mandatory time box will put a limit on how long after call work can be and that will actually apply in this option here for the after call work timeout which is in seconds so as an example here if i have 30 seconds in this box then with this setup mandatory time box and an after call work timeout of 30 seconds your agent is going to automatically be placed into after call work after his call is done they would be able to leave after call work at any time that they deem appropriate however after 30 seconds they are automatically removed from after call work and are placed back into the queue so that that would be an example of time box here and then finally there is also mandatory time box no early exit and in this case and you can see here it does apply to voice conversations here um in this particular case with the same setup your agent will be placed into after call work for 30 seconds they cannot leave after call work and after 30 seconds they would be placed back into the queue so this would be essentially a mandatory 30-second break for them to finish up whatever it is that they were doing to allow allow them to be ready for their next interaction in addition there is this box for manual assignment this allows from the supervisor tab this allows um folks to actually place people into the queue as needed manual assignment would allow that to occur with this off you would have to be a member of the queue to be active in the queue so that would be for temporary assignment for things like overflow purposes
Routing and that concludes the general tab the next thing we're going to go to is the routing tab here the routing tab can go from fairly simple to fairly complex and so we're going to talk about that here there are three different methods of routing within genesis cloud you have standard routing which would simply be longest idle for your agents so if you have a number of agents in the queue it is not looking for anything like skills-based routing it isn't looking for anything specific there it is just looking at your pool of agents who is available and is going to choose whoever has been available the longest to send that call to
Bullseye Routing your other options however are bullseye routing and preferred agent routing we're going to start with bullseye routing because this is a very common methodology for routing within the system what bullseye routing does is it allows you to add different um different bullseye markers um or points in the system where you can specify which agents should get calls first um and you can do things like remove skills to to increase your pool of agents um and add multiple rings to this to to kind of create an escalation and overflow for your queue
Bullseye Routing Example so as an example here if i add just a couple rings here um it's going to start at point one which you can see is listed as one and then it will move to two and then three and then finally it would end at four and all these are configurable so for example let's say i want my initial agents to be um to get the call for 30 seconds before it moves to 0.2 maybe i want this to then ring for 90 seconds and keep in mind here anything anything um that was in marker one also applies to two here so once we move to two any agents with with bullseye two will be ring as well as any agents that become available under bullseye one um and then finally once it gets to three anything in three would be added to that as well so in this particular case call would come in it would ring any agents marked as bullseye one for 30 seconds then it would ring anybody anybody with bullseye 2 or bullseye 1 for 90 seconds and then anybody with three two or one for 90 seconds and then after that once it hits four all agents in the queue become available here so this can be used as an overflow where you have some um some agents that potentially can handle the calls that could come into the queue um or interactions for that matter because it can be any other type of interaction for this as well um but um should not be the front line this would be a way to do that in addition if you do use skill based routing in your system you can remove skills with each of these bullseye ring exits to improve the ability to take these calls so for example maybe you have a support queue that uses support scaling um support skill the support skill would be required to answer any of those calls coming through the queue um but maybe after on bullseye ring three you would then remove that skill which it looks like we don't have one directly searchable but um the um if you remove the skill that's no longer attached to the call and queue and then anybody that doesn't have the skill could then pick up the call so this allows you to use um overflow agents that aren't necessarily skilled for the for the calls that they would be taking as overflow just to make sure that they can actually pick those calls up um now um this goes hand in hand with your evaluation method um which the default in the system is going to be all skills matching if there is a skill associated with the call which happens via architect then it looks for anybody in the queue that has that skill to match um your other options are best available skills this is actually based on the skills slider that you can assign to agents so this would be the star rating that you give them for the skill best available skills is going to take a look at the agents that are available that have the correct skill and then it was going to prefer the agents that have a higher skill level of that available skill and then finally there's also disregard skills next agent this does this simply tells the system not to care if you're using a skill on the cued call or not it's simply going to look for the next available agent that has been idle for the longest so you can use any of those for whatever method you need here um now
Preferred Agent Routing this is for bullseye routing there is also preferred agent routing which i'm going to go over briefly here this is actually more architect than it is q methodology um however what this will allow you to do is configure preferred agents for specific interaction types in architect and you can add rings for specific scores for those agents so it's very similar to bullseye routing and skill based routing is just another way to do so and you can actually combine this with standard or bullseye routing as well so you can do a preferred list of agents followed by bullseye routing if you so desire if you want more information on preferred agent routing that would be covered in a later course that would that would revolve around architect if you have any questions about it that would be a good thing to contact our support team about
Members next let's go to members and this is going to let me show you the bullseye by routing as well so i'm actually going to before we get in there i'm going to save this real quick and then go back to it
Save Settings which another thing to note about the cues and really any tab within architect or i'm sorry within genesis cloud is if you go and save your settings it is going to pop you back out to the main page let's do that so we just have two available there um so that is something to keep in mind just make sure that you have the settings in that you want to put into the key
Add New Members so now that that's set up here let's go ahead and go to members here and you'll see i have a blank slate here i don't have any members in my page at the moment now to select new members i can search by by specific name so if i look for tom here so i've got a few wfm users that i use for another training that i do if i wanted to add these users to the queue i could simply choose them and you'll see it gets added into that little box here and then when i hit this little plus now
Advanced Tab all of those users are added if i wanted to look a little bit harder at the users that i can add i can click this advanced tab this advanced tab will allow me to search by different different methods so for example maybe they're all in an official group within genesis cloud i could look for that group i could look for that specific role if i have my users set up so that i um have their manager information on their profiles and i know who they report to i can do that i can also look by location skill or language and you can use this pane to add users as well so this will allow you to do um very much the same thing that the search by name does you can find multiple people check their boxes and add multiple people to the group this way as well
Bullseye down below you'll see all the users that i have created in in the queue here and there's a bullseye ring number as well for each one of these users which you can see i can actually manipulate between one and six so you can have up to six total bullseye rings within the system um now the um this is going to dictate when they get ranked so for example if wfm1 and 2 were bullseye ring one they would be in that first group and if three and four are set as bullseye ring two they would start getting rang as part of the second bullseye marker so to go back to the routing here in our example here wfm users one and two would ring for five seconds and then all four of them would be able to get rang after it moves to bullseye ring two so that's that's how bullseye works it's very very simplistic but allows you to do things like set up tiers for your queues so that you can have overflow available
Wrapup Codes the next tab here is wrap-up codes and wrap-up codes are simply the codes that your agents can choose at the end of a call that can be used in reporting to see what kind of calls are coming in so for example here if i just type in i'll just grab a couple of them here not support request not interested and not so happy customer and we'll go ahead and hit the add button here
Wrapup Codes Overview this is all there is to it for wrap-up codes so wrap-up codes are going to vary based on um the customer and what what your needs are so everybody's wrapped up codes will be a little bit different um these these are codes that you can create yourself and then you simply make them available in the queue by adding them in the wrap up codes tab here the end result is if i get a call from this queue and uh um and i get connected to it i can choose one of these wrap-up codes um on the end of the upon the end of the call to notate what kind of call it was and then reporting can be used to pull this call information so um this this is purely for reporting and to make sure you know what kind of calls are coming into your contact center
Service Level Target and finally we have our different interaction types so we're going to go through these as well voice has by far the most which makes sense because there's more that can happen with voice so let's talk about the service level and the service level target these are reporting metrics and are meant to be used in conjunction with performance dance dashboards to see where your cues lie and if you're meeting your targets so the default is going to be a service level of 80 with a cert or i'm sorry a service level of 80 percent with the service level of target of 20 seconds what this means is the system is looking to see that 80 of the voice interactions offered to this queue are answered within 20 seconds so that gives you an average service level that you can be looking at for your queue and the performance dashboard will give you feedback on this level and depending on what you configure will show you whether or not you're meeting your targets so this is something that can be configurable depending on the customer and queue need um 80 out of 20 is a pretty common um setup that we do see
Calling Party underneath here we have a calling party name and a calling party number and these are on the queue because in a queue-based interaction setup within genesis cloud your agents can actually make calls on behalf of their queue to return calls to customers when you when this is done um the calling party name if you're using for example genesis cloud voice um as well as the calling party number that you specify here is what is going to be outpost when you send those calls outbound now the name does have to be honored by the by the carriers going and end so that can that can change um depending on whether or not the database of the um last mile carrier to the person you're calling does have the name that you were sending however the calling party number is consistent and will be whatever you need um so the a good example for this here would be a number that would actually directly connect the um person you called back to the queue so they know that that is you um so that is what these two fields are for you also have an alerting timeout this is how long your agents will get notified that they have an incoming call before it moves the next agent therefore putting that agent into not responding the default for this is eight seconds
Queue Flows underneath here are some um q flow and default scripts that you can look for for these queues the default script is going to be a script that your agents can look at and use for play-by-play for their calls depending on your organization you may or may not use these scripts if you do have a script that you want to use and you want it to be the default for the queue no matter when they get a call you can put that script name into the default script and it will get pulled by default unless there is an architect flow that overrides it the same applies for the in queue flow by default the enqueue flow is going to use the default in queue flow within architect if you have a specific enqueue flow that has messaging that applies to this queue you can specify it here generally you will see that these enqueue flows are actually called within architect so this is already handled for you but if you have a specific flow that you would like to use for this queue anytime it's reached you can put it into the box here as well whisper audio is simply going to let you let you know when there's an incoming call um and if you want to use it there's a whisper prompt box that you can use here this will play in this will play audio for an agent as a call comes in you can set it up so that either whisper audio plays for all agents so you can set up a prompt for anybody that's getting a call or if an agent is configured for auto answer meaning they don't get a choice whether or not they pick up the call it just beeps into their headset you can play whisper audio for only those agents as well there's also the option for voice transcription if you have voice transcription on for your voicemails which is an organization-wide setting you can turn this on as well so that you will have voice transcription
Chat chat is very very simple um chat is going is going to refer to web chat so if you're using any sort of website based chat with genesis cloud and you're using this queue to handle those those chat messages this is going to give you more service level information which you can see again 80 of chat interactions within 20 seconds is the default here we do have a different alerting timeout which is set to 30 seconds for chat to give people a little bit more time to handle a chat interaction and get started there before it would move to the next agent and then again just like with voice you have a default script option the default script option would just allow your agent to see a visual script with options for them for those interactions
Messaging and the same is essentially true for messaging um which this is this is going to be more web hook messaging such as things such as through sms um and you can see here the service level and the learning timeout are exactly the same as chat you still have the default script however there is also an outbound sms number drop down that you can use this is going to correspond to an sms number that you would purchase through genesis cloud and that number will be used to outpost any messages that you send in this format
Email email again very much the same the big difference with email is going to be that service level target which you can see is actually defaulting to 86 400 seconds um with a much higher alerting timeout of 300 seconds this is because email unlike the other messaging types is generally not a real-time experience so this is designed to give your agents a little bit more time if you are using email in your queues um you can obviously adjust these to whatever that whatever you would like to use you can specify an outbound email address to send to send these um these emails from um as well as a default script for that as well um so if you have a specific script for email you can use it there if you have a specific outbound address that you would like to use for answering email interactions you can do that as well and then finally you have a callback tab
callback as well um callback is just simply an interaction in which a the caller has selected that they would like a callback this does have to be offered within architect in order for that to be something that can be done and just just like any of the other interaction types it's it's governed by its own service level and its own alerting timeout um so this allows you to track that and make sure that your callbacks are working properly
time in seconds and so with that we got about four minutes left that does cover the options within the queues function within genesis cloud it does look like there is a couple of questions here so let's go ahead and handle these in a real time here first one is there a maximum time in seconds to define for after call work there absolutely is but i can't remember what it is let's find out one second here it looks like it might be 99 seconds because i can't go any further and it looks like it let me it looks like it let me define that so let me go back here let's see if it'll let me do any more here there we go that's why apparently you can go up to 900 seconds so you you do have quite a bit of time you can you can place here the other option you do have though is you can set it to discretionary to give your agents as much time as they require
discretionary do the evaluation methods only apply once it hits the final ring or do they apply to all the rings they do apply to all the rings so for example here um in the routing tab if we're looking at ring one which we'll just say 45 seconds just to make a little easier to follow it does follow the evaluation method so the first thing it's going to do is it's going to find the users that are um that are available um that have either the appropriate skill or if we're doing disregard skill um it would just find the longest idle user if we're set to best available skills though it's going to find those users and then of those available users it will select the user that best fits the skill so it does get used at all times any other questions all right don't see anything else coming through give it just a moment here okay so it looks like that is all the questions that we have at this point in time if more questions come up after the webinar as usually happens that's not a problem you can always get in touch with us after the fact and we can make sure we get those answers to you so you can always give us a call at 844-446-3569 or send us an email at contactedinflowcommunications.com just give us a general description of your question we'll make sure that we get the answer for you not a problem and so with that that concludes our webinar for today um my name is tom with inflow thank you so much for taking the time to join us today we do hope to see you in the future and as always i hope you guys have a wonderful day thanks everybody have a good one bye
